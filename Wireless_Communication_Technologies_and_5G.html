<p>The operation of mobile networks is based on a cellular communication technology. The coverage area of ​​a mobile network is divided into geometric areas called cells. Each cell is covered by a cell tower and serves an area where users can make calls or connect to the internet. When the user moves from one cell to another, the network takes over the connection change (handoff) without interruption.</p>

<h3>Network Structure and Components</h3>
    <p>A mobile network consists of various components:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>Base Stations:</b> These antennas are located in each cell and communicate with mobile devices. Each antenna serves a specific geographic area.</li>
        <li><b>Switching Equipment:</b> The equipment that manages calls and data. It is responsible for connecting users to the network and rerouting calls or data.</li>
        <li><b>Gateways:</b> These units enable communication between the mobile network and other networks, such as the fixed telephone network or the internet.</li>
    </ul>
